Required for submission of diary file after running polyspace on input (a):
For (a), P is not a basis for R^4. It neither spans R^4 nor is linearly independent. From the reduced row echelon form, we can see that it does not span because there is not a pivot position in each row, and we can see that it isn't linearly independent because there isn't a pivot position in each column.
